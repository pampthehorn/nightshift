<h1>Nightshift - Homosapien</h1>

<p>Now 5 years deep in existence, Glasgow's NIGHTSHIFT continue to surf the dazzling plains of their collective reality via
an almost elemental take on music and friendship.</p>

<p>With their latest offering Homosapien due for release on ??/??/?? via Trouble in Mind, a noticeable alteration has taken
place since the band's debut LP Zoe.</p>

<p>Chris White (Spinning Coin) now picks up the guitar instead of drums (his previous role in the band) providing a whole
new dimension to their sound.</p>

<p>His distinctive playing delivers a countrified energy that is central to the forthcoming album, leading the song
structures into more succinct and colourful places, matching the upbeat and playful nature the band has always drawn
strength from, only more so now under his stylish approach.</p>

<p>The kinetic drumming of Rob Alexander (Tarantula/Radio Banter) allows for a second new development in the band dynamic.
Replacing Chris (his longtime friend from childhood) is no mean feat. Thankfully his drumming is an avalanche of skilful
technique with a glorious abandon that swerves it away from the academic and absolutely into a wild and tactile
performance that lifts the sound and finalises a metamorphosis for the group.</p>

<p>Still at the beating heart of proceedings is Eothen Stern (also of 2 Ply). Her incredible vocalisms, keyboard,
percussion, and lyrical gifts illuminate the group's output with an optimistic urgency that is unmatched.</p>

<p>On Homosapien she wears her heart on her sleeve in places, but even in the song's darkest moments, the words create a
sense of hope and potential that is synonymous with Eothen as a person. She doesn't shy away from politics or
contemporary love languages and finds humour, earnestness, and critique at every turn.</p>

<p>Andrew Robert Doig continues to play bass (Dancer/Robert Sotelo) and provides occasional lead vocals.</p>

<p>With these newest songs born out of some genuinely existential times (birth, death and love all played a very real part
in the gestation of the new record) it's a great irony that Nightshift are sculpting their most succinct and tuneful
music yet from this potential chaos, but it's this unexpected quality that drives them onwards into a dizzying universe.</p>

    <h2>ALBUM THOUGHTS</h2> 
    
    <h3>Doig:</h3>
    
    <p>We recorded the album in our old space (which we actually lost recently). <strong>Chris</strong> and
        <strong>Rob</strong> recorded it, mixed it etc.</p>
    
    <p>We had to start again a bit due to the line-up change. Started Summer 2023 and began to assemble and record the new
        set of songs. It was fun and relatively quick!</p>
    
    <p>Lyrical meanings I would rather not speak for <strong>Eo</strong>'s songs. My main lyric is <strong>Mellow
            Baby</strong> which is about <strong>Chris</strong>'s little son <strong>Casper</strong> playing about in his
        living room and the positive but chaotic energy of that.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Together We Roll</strong>, which I mostly sing, is about feeling relieved that the band is always able to
        survive our various upheavals, there's a family-like dynamic that helps us survive anything!</p>
    
    <p>Our friend <strong>Anthony Gerace</strong> did the artwork and sleeve.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Mellow Baby</strong> was considered for the album title, but <strong>Homosapien</strong> is taken from the
        same song.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Eo</strong> thought it sounded more iconic, almost like something a Pet Shop Boys album would be called.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Ray Aggs</strong> once again contributed fiddle to a couple of songs, which really helps them to soar.</p>
    
    <p>In terms of musical inspiration, I know <strong>Eo</strong> has mentioned <strong>Anna Domino</strong> a lot
        recently, so maybe that plays a part somewhere in there. I think there's a bit of <strong>Sebadoh</strong> and
        country in <strong>Chris</strong>'s guitar style, but also a bit of classic rock in a way.</p>
    
    <p>Maybe a little mid-era <strong>Deerhunter</strong> in the sense that the songs have become a little more poppy and
        shorter.</p>
    
    <p>I think <strong>Sure Look</strong> is probably the best thing we have done, it was written when I wasn't there and it
        blew me away when I first heard it.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Cut</strong> is an interesting song where <strong>Rob</strong> (who is very multi-instrumental) plays
        accordion and tin whistle. It also sounds a bit like <strong>Young Marble Giants</strong> playing a classic
        <strong>Metallica</strong> ballad to my ears.</p>
    
    <h3>Eo:</h3>
    
    <p><strong>Crystal ball:</strong> Have to say this idea came about through the despair of the aftermath of Brexit and
        going back to visit the seaside town surrounding the area I'm from in the south coast of England, an area that is
        inherently very Tory/conservative and voted to leave. This was one of the many to follow scary moves towards
        fascism. This ongoing idea that you believe there is progress but your idea of progress, community, acceptance,
        difference is not other people's idea of progress and ultimately it is regression to darker years.</p>
    
    <p>The song refers to the scary reality that many people feel to tighten border control and hostile fear of others.
        “Archaic seaside voting for the oppressor, you'll never get the upper hand. Take my hand and understand” The idea of
        bringing people in and not making them feel like no one cares about them. But also being angry that they aren't able
        to accept anything but fascism.</p>
    
    <p>The area I'm from is on the south coast of England, an area that is inherently very Tory/conservative.
        <strong>Glasgow</strong> is more left/socialist leaning.</p>
    
    <p>Fight around left and right and have recently been very inspired by <strong>Naomi Klein</strong>'s
        <strong>Doppaganer</strong> book talking about political diagonalism and how the jump from the left to the right is
        all warped.</p>
    
    <p>I was thinking about how in austerity there can become this scarcity politics where marginalized groups also turn
        against one another. When they in fact have more in common under the same oppressive government than they realize.
    </p>
    
    <p><strong>Cut:</strong> Welfare cuts and heartbreak throughout Winter. The line “When you cut we bleed” is the slogan
        to the inspiring group <strong>Sisters Uncut</strong>, a British feminist direct action group that is opposed to
        cuts to UK government services for domestic violence victims. Recorded at a time when I was reflecting on the
        ongoing rage of Gender based violence for women and trans/nb folk.</p>
    
    <p>The song is one of the slower songs on the album and has a bit of a medieval vibe. The chord progression is simple
        but it gets in as a deep cut. <strong>Rob</strong>'s tin whistle and accordion playing really make the song to me
        and chime his folk heritage which he and his family share. Such a lovely thing to be such a holistic musician, in
        the same way that <strong>Chris</strong> is playing guitar now.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Side effects:</strong> Also around cuts. I work for a charity here in <strong>Glasgow</strong>, see people
        really struggling and are not given any dignity. From the right to work as someone who is an asylum seeker status
        ect. But also ideas around being 'fit to work' and everything linking to labor and capitalism production. Then also
        other kind of links to medication: the bridge features the warnings inside of a medication package that I found in
        our old practice space. Dosage/side effects ect. But then it kind of linked though blanketed medication as a use of
        not being overwhelmed or daring to feeling anything in late capitalism.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Phone:</strong> Kind of channeling <strong>Robyn</strong> with separating the words phonetically on her
        <strong>Honey</strong> album. Having my ex and former long term partner of 9 years play on the track with the two
        instruments singled out at the end like call and response felt important and like a phone call. Or like a reprise.
        Used to hear <strong>Ray</strong> play fiddle in the flat all the time so was a nice echo of that instrument
        presence and absence. Also has a bit of a chamber orchestra and the recent trend of putting more generic pop music
        to soloed out strings.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Crush:</strong> Crushes that feeling when you fancy someone and you don't know what to do about it. Breakup
        renaissance when you are re-assessing who you are and what your values are. Crossroads.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Sure Look:</strong> A love letter to yourself to take care of yourself but also a hopefully moment of calm. I
        believe the words came into my mind inspired by my current partner's use of the phrase. It's kind of untangling and
        calm. Again my ex playing on it marks a progression of time and the song has a nice groove and repetition.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Your Good Self:</strong> Again self preservation but not in an individualist way. Mentions various emotions
        combined beauty/pain, laughter/decay. Someone said to me in passing “for your good self” and it just stuck.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Together we roll:</strong> It's more <strong>Doig</strong>'s song. I love playing it live. It has a B52
        inspired key chord repeated and a kinda cool driving through the desert feel in my head.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Tutorial:</strong> It is a silly track on the album. I find it a bit cringy but then that's sometimes good to
        feel that with songs and it's fun and fast to play and makes me laugh with the middle 8. I believe I was thinking
        about youtube tutorials and open source acquiring of skills online but also how many of the tutorials are by young
        teenagers. Bake, fake, fix, wax, max. Talking about millions and followers, kind of a saturation point with where
        we're at with the extremity of poverty and millions. Think it was written at the time when I saw <strong>Elon
            Musk</strong>'s <strong>Starlink</strong> in my friends allotment and I had just had a week of witnessing very
        vulnerable people at work with the cost of living crisis. These kinds of extremities.</p>
    
    <p><strong>SUV:</strong> Another more silly song on the album. With my lover between me talking about bourgeoisie,
        polyamory and SUVs. “I live in a big house, insanity”. The idea of owning your house seems impossible to me and
        playful ethics around love, consumerism, values. Again people seem left leaning and layers can be peeled back behind
        that confort being at what cost. It's kind of got a fantasy semi erotic daydream vibe.</p>
    
    <p>I'm not pro SUVs at all. There are loads in my neighborhood and they scare me!</p>
